# eTrack
IBC Track Page Sample

This is a basic HTML sample with a very basic interface to show how to implement the new IBC eTrack interface.

For further details on the API please visit: https://api.pactrak.com/ibcairbill/eTrack-documentation.html.

The HTML uses mainly the JQuery HTML tag creation techniques to feed the elements into tables.

Any suggestions, questions or concerned, please email it@ibcinc.com.
